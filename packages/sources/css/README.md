> Decathlon Design System - Vitamin CSS library

## Technologies

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - All this package is generated with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. Be careful, in order to use our library, you will have to prefix all CSS utility classes with `vtmn-`.
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) - Under the hood, we use PostCSS to build our library.

## Contributing

One of the Decathlon Design System goals is to provide guidelines & components to gain in consistency, efficiency & accessibility. The best way to achieve this is together!
That's why we are on GitHub. We would love contributions from the community (bug reports, feature requests, suggestions, Pull Requests, whatever you want!).
