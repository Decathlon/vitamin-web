# `css`

> The CSS library hosts the `@decathlon/vitamin-css` package which is composed of our CSS styles.

## Work In Progress

For the moment, this package is not published on NPM. We still have issues before finishing our [MVP](https://github.com/Decathlon/vitamin-web/projects/1).

## Technology stack

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - All this package is generated with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. Be careful, in order to use our library, you will have to prefix all CSS utility classes with `vtmn-`.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - CSS guidelines & components are exposed in a Storybook to help you understand how to consume this package.
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) - Under the hood, we use PostCSS to build our library.
