## Showcase's theme switcher

As you probably see just above in the "Extented" toolbar, you have a "Theme Switcher" available. Feel free to test it directly inside this showcase to switch between our different themes!

## Usage

If you want to switch between different themes in your project, you can do it easily by simply toggling CSS classes of the section where you want to see your components changed their theme.

For the moment, we have one theme available (Core) with two different modes (Light & Dark), here are their CSS classes:

- `.vtmn-theme_core--light`
- `.vtmn-theme_core--dark`

_For your information, if you don't set any CSS class for theming, the theme will be Core theme (Light mode) by default._

### With global CSS package

You just need to apply one of these classes listed above and your child elements will use the theme you defined automatically.

### With specific CSS packages

If you want to use different themes for specific CSS packages like `@vtmn/css-button`, `@vtmn/css-toggle` etc., you will need to import the CSS variables via `@vtmn/css-design-tokens` package, then use the file that contains CSS classes for specific elements with CSS variables inside.

For this, be sure to install & import `@vtmn/css-design-tokens` before:

```sh
# with npm
npm i -S @vtmn/css-design-tokens

# with yarn
yarn add @vtmn/css-design-tokens
```

Or you can also install it with a CDN like `unpkg.com`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@vtmn/css-design-tokens" />
```

With a bundler that supports CSS imports in JS files:

```javascript
import '@vtmn/css-design-tokens/dist/index.css';
import '@vtmn/css-<your-component>/dist/index-with-vars.css';
```

Otherwise include it in your HTML file:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="./node_modules/@vtmn/css-design-tokens/dist/index.css"
/>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="./node_modules/@vtmn/css-<your-component>/dist/index-with-vars.css"
/>
```

Then, you just need to apply one of these classes listed above and your child elements will use the theme you defined automatically.

## Examples

### Core theme (Light mode)

<div class="vtmn-theme_core--light vtmn-p-2">
  <button class="vtmn-btn">Button in Core theme (Light mode)</button>
</div>

<Source
  code={dedent`
    <div class="vtmn-theme_core--light">
      <button class="vtmn-btn">Button in Core theme (Light mode)</button>
    </div>
  `}
/>

### Core theme (Dark mode)

<div class="vtmn-theme_core--dark vtmn-p-2">
  <button class="vtmn-btn">Button in Core theme (Dark mode)</button>
</div>

<Source
  code={dedent`
    <div class="vtmn-theme_core--dark">
      <button class="vtmn-btn">Button in Core theme (Dark mode)</button>
    </div>
  `}
/>

## To go further

The `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature is used to detect if the user has requested a light or dark color theme.
The user might indicate this preference through an operating system setting (e.g. light or dark mode) or a user agent setting.

If you want to use it to directly choose the correct theme based on the user preference, we invite you to follow [this documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).
